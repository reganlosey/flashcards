#### Technologies Used:
##### Javascript
##### Mocha
##### Chai

#### Project Overview:

This project was a demonstration of my accumulated knowledge regarding JavaScript class-to-class interactions and assertion testing using Mocha and Chai. The goal was to add to a basic code foundation to create a multiple choice trivia style game that could be played completely from the terminal command line.
